# IMPORTANT

These are the formatting rules I used for the save file and it will help to read them.

Syntax for save files:

===========================================================

startupMessage 	= `<T><T>`
  
optionText 		= 	`<"0"><"0">` where 0 is the index of the entry.

optionAddition 	= 	`<'0'><'0'>` where 0 is the index of the entry.

optionGroups		=	`<:0:>1,2<:0:>` where 0 is the index of the group, and 1,2 is the list of the entries separated by commas

===========================================================

Overrides are done by the last conflicting thing in the file being chosen.

Important sections of the text are denoted by `<!></!>` and will show up as blue text.

Newline characters are denoted as \n and ONLY usable in the optionAddition tag.
