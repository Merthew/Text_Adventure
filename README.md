startupMessage  = <T><T> 
optionText      = <"0"><"0"> where 0 is the index of the entry.
optionAddition  = <'0'><'0'> where 0 is the index of the entry.
optionGroups    = <:0:>1,2<:0:> where 0 is the index of the group, and 1,2 is the list of the entries separated by commas

Overrides are done by the last conflicting thing in the file being chosen.
Important sections of the text are denoted by <!></!> and will show up as blue text.
Newline characters are denoted as \n and ONLY usable in the optionAddition tag.
